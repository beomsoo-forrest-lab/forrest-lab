                            Forrest lab is a partnership of two architects â€“ Puisto and CELT. Puisto and CELT established their office in Finland in 2018. The office is currently located in both, Helsinki, and Seoul.

                            Forrest lab is a progressive and contemporary practice that focuses on architecture and design - from urban planning to buildings, interiors, objects, and products. As an active part of a design process, Pirinen & Salo is involved throughout the whole process, from the first sketch to on-site supervision.
